        <h1>Broken Buttons</h1>
        <h2>A thought experiment</h2>
        <h3 class="visually-hidden">
          Note: This page contains a button
          without any visual text on it to make a point to
          visual users that accessibility issues should be treated 
          as bugs in software development.
        </h3>
        <p>Imagine you saw the following button:</p>
        <a href="broken_page.html" class="blank-button" aria-label="Click here to get free coffee for life!"></a>
        <p>
          You might think that the button is broken,
          that somehow the content is
          being displayed incorrectly.
          You'd think it's a bug. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So you tell the web developers
          who made that button, and they
          say that whatever issue you have 
          with the website, it's not
          a priority. Everything works fine <i>for them.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          But it gets worse, because you would then find out
          that other people got the following content: 
        </p>
        <audio controls>
          <source src="/audio/blank_button.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>
        <a href="transcript.html" class="external-link">transcript</a>
        <p>
          But by the time you found out, if you ever found out, 
          the promotion was over and you lost out. 
        </p>
        <p>
          That would suck, wouldn't it? 
        </p>
        <p>
          What if that would happen every day,
          and it was about much more important things?
          Imagine you encountered a similar issue every
          time you tried to

        </p>
        <h3>My plea to you:</h3>
        <p>
          Treat accessibility issues as functional bugs, 
          because that is what they are, and prioritise them accordingly.
          Pretend like a lifetime supply of free coffee depended on it.
