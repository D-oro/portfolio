          Whether you're already a hot shit developer building the next
          spotify, or only just fell in love with coding, here are
          three technical skills that every developer should hone to
          build more accessibly.
        </p>
        <h2>1. Learn about browsers accessibility testing tools</h2>
        <p>
          Did you know many browsers have integrated accessibility testing tools?<br/>
          Firefox for example comes with a lot of useful tools, such as automated testing, a colour perception simulator,
          visual tabbing order, and the accessibility tree which can be exported to JSON.<br/>
          Have a look:
          <a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/accessibility_inspector/">
            Firefox Accessibility Inspector Documentation
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Firefox Accessibility Inspector is nice for its simplicity, but other tools such as Lighthouse (e.g Chrome and Brave) have more extensive features:

        <h2>2. Learn to navigate by keyboard only</h2>
        <p>
          A great website doesn't rely on a mouse alone for navigation.
          Ensuring good keyboard navigation can make interacting with your
          webpage faster and easier for a lot of people.
          Yet, many developers don't know there are specific keyboard controls for
          native HTML elements, so let's change that!
          Here are some of the most common keyboard controls:
          <h3>Tab</h3>
          <p>Use <mark>Tab</mark> to go to the next interactive element.</p>
          <h3>Shift + Tab</h3>
          <p>Use <mark>Shift</mark> + <mark>Tab</mark> to go to the previous interactive element.</p>
          <h3>Enter or return</h3>
          <p>Use <mark><span aria-hidden="true">&crarr;&nbsp;</span>Enter</mark> (or <mark>return</mark>) to activate links and some buttons</p>
          <h3>spacebar</h3>
          <p>Use <mark>spacebar</mark> to check checkboxes, click buttons and expand menus</p>
          <p>You can also use spacebar to scroll down</p>
          <h3>Shift + spacebar</h3>
          <p>Use <mark>Shift</mark> + <mark>spacebar</mark> to scroll up</p>
          <h3>arrow keys</h3>
          <p>Use the
            <mark><span aria-hidden="true">&uarr;</span></mark> up,
            <mark><span aria-hidden="true">&darr;</span></mark> down,
            <mark><span aria-hidden="true">&larr;</span></mark> left,
            <mark><span aria-hidden="true">&rarr;</span></mark> right arrow keys to move between radio buttons and options in select drop-down menus</p>
          <h3>Esc</h3>
          <p>Use <mark>Esc</mark> key to close pop up menus, overlay modals, select menus, and dismiss notifications</p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> Not every website is going to implement keyboard navigation in the same way,
            but this is how native HTML elements can be interacted with, at least in theory.
            A good place to practive this are UK Government websites, for example the
            <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/">GOV.UK Design Systems webpage</a>.
          </p>

        <h2>3. Learn how to use a screen reader</h2>
        <p>
          There is a lot to know about using a screen reader and novices will look clumsy compared to
          folks who use screen readers every day. It cannot be said often enough: Disabled people are the experts,
          so you should try to get native screen reader users to test your app.
        </p>
        <p>
          That being said, I think there is value in understanding
          that there are many different ways to perceive the same webpage,
          and if you only use your eyes you will miss a whole
          different dimension.
        </p>
        <h3>Moving between elements: Tab, Shift + Tab</h3>
        <p>
          Before we turn the screenreader on, let's start with what to do
          once the screen reader is running:<br/>
          Use <mark>Tab</mark> and <mark>Shift</mark> + <mark>Tab</mark> to move between <strong>interactive elements</strong>.
          That already gives you a better idea about how a page is structured
          for screen readers.
        </p>
        <p>
          To read <strong>text or other non-interactive elements</strong>, you can try
          clicking on them using your <strong>mouse</strong>, or check out the links below
          for more info on the keyboard controls for each screen reader.
        </p>
