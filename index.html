          <strong>"So what does a software developer do?"</strong> I asked my
          friend as we wandered through our local park on a sunny spring morning
          in 2022. "We build things, fix problems, it's basically like solving
          puzzles all day." I looked at her with amazement. "You can get paid
          for solving puzzles???"
        </p>
        <p>
          That same evening I looked up CodeClan, an intensive coding bootcamp
          in Scotland, and wrote my first lines of JavaScript on Codecademy. The
          next day I signed up to the bootcamp and said goodbye to a career in
          psychology to become a professional puzzle solver instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          And oh how I enjoy solving puzzles every day! Since then, I have
          deciphered many riddles in <strong>Java and Spring</strong>, built
          worlds in <strong>React, Angular and Typescript</strong>, and
          uncovered mysteries of failing
          <strong
            >pipelines, database management, and continuous deployment</strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also discovered a particular fondness for learning about the
          complex challenge of making the things we build work for everyone and
          have talked about juggling hedgehogs and other
          <strong>accessibility</strong>
          issues at multiple meetups and conferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you seek a professional puzzle solver with a thirst for learning
          new things, <strong>I would love to hear from you</strong>.
