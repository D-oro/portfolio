        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          "So what does a software developer do?" I asked my friend as we
          wandered through our local park on a sunny spring morning in 2022. "We
          build things, fix problems, it's basically like solving puzzles all
          day." I looked at her with amazement. "You can get paid for solving
          puzzles???" <br />
          That same evening I looked up CodeClan, an intensive coding bootcamp
          in Scotland, and wrote my first lines of JavaScript on Codecademy. The
          next day I signed up to the bootcamp and said goodbye to a career in
          psychology to become a professional puzzle solver instead. <br />
          And oh how I enjoy solving puzzles every day! Since then, I have
          deciphered many riddles in Java and Spring, built worlds in React,
          Angular and Typescript, and uncovered mysteries of failing pipelines,
          databases, and continuous deployment.
